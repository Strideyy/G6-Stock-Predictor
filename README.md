# G6-Stock-Predictor
A machine learning program, used to predict stocks. Currently using NASDAQ data. 

# How to use:
To use this program, install from this repository and run the TSE_dev.py file. Work through the text boxes and click enter after each input to see a graph of that company's historical performance and a prediction graph from your investment. Alternatively, follow the video guide found here.

# **Important, Please Read:**

When inputting a company to view their stocks, please refer to the list of companies in the "sample" folder found on the master branch. Inputs must be in capitals and without the ".csv" file type. 

# FAQ's
=> What machine learning model does this use?

We are currently utilising the LSTM (Long-short-term-memory) model to train our dataset for a prediction. 

=> Can this model be applied to other datasets?

This feature will come in the next update. 

=> Is there a way to report bugs?

Yes, feel free to add a new issue through GitHub or contact us directly via tseg6lincoln@outlook.com

=> When is the next update?

Hopefully sometime in June or July. 

# TO DO:
- Finish Prediction graph
- Validate inputs
- Re-add functionality described in prototype
- Add ability to use other datasets
